Question 1.1


Description: 
Detect if a given IP address or Host Name is online or not. The job creator would like the job seeker to find out if a given IP address is contacted to the network or not. The job description contains at least the target IP. 



Summary: 
0. Assume the IP address is used for idetifying target.
1. Job seeker will craft a ICMP echo query message. 
2. A IP packet will be created with ip set to tarket ip, and ICMP packet insert into its data section.
3. The IP packet will be sent. 
4. If the target port is active, then job seeker will recieve a echo-reply ICMP message. 
5. If the target port is non-active, then the packet will time out and job seeker will recieve no message. (router will not reply ICMP on ICMP)
	



Design: 

Job creator send request
------------------------ 
1 job creator inlcude a string (IP which it want to be tested) in its application protocol's data segment. 
2. job creator send this (segment) to transport layer / IP layer through scoket.  
3.  After transport / network layer add thier header and tailer, link layer make it into frame and sent to physical layer, which in turn send on the network.


Job seeker uppacked target IP and create ICMP encapslated in IP 
----------------------------------------------------------------
4. job seeker reveive the bit stream, assemble and unpack all the layer up to application layer. 
5. Once retrived the string (which is the target ip addres), job seeker call pcpp::lcmplayer object to create an ICMP echo query. 
6. set ICMP echo query header:
	type=8
	code=0
	identifier =0
	sequence number =0 
7. set ICMP data to null. 	 
8. job seeker call pcpc::?? to create ip object.
9. set IP header: 
	source ip = host id 
	destine ip = target ip
	....
10. encapuslate ICMP inside IP packet's data segement. 
11. send out ip packet, and set a timer in case of no reply. 


Job seeker wait response and create final report 
------------------------------------------------
12. if successfully recived echo-reply ICMP from target IP job seeker craft an success report for job creator. 
13. if time out, job seeker craft an fail report to job creator. 	

Job seeker send report and complete job
---------------------------------------
14. job seeker package report into application layer 's data segement, pass it down all the way to datalink layer frame (through socket), and send it back to job creator. 
15. End.
