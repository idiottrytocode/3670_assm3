Question 1.2


Description: 
2. The job creator ask more than one job seeker to execute a TCP flood attack ( any TCP flood attack) against a given port on a given IP


Summary: 
0. Job creator send IP to mutiple job seekers 
1. Job seeker use create a TCP packet with header 
2. Job seeker create IP pakcet, insert TCP inside its data section, and set IP header with destine ip = target ip
3. Job seeker execute attack by entering a 10000000 loop to send IP packet to target.



Design Plan: 

Job creator send request (target IP) to job seekers 
------------------------------------------------ 
1. job creator create application message using user defined protocols. 
2. creator inter ip address as string into data section of application message.  
3. creator create socket and sending application package through TCP/IP protocol to job seeker. 


Job seeker uppacked target info and prepare ICMP segement
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Job seeker unpack the job following communication rule. 
2. seeker call TCPpacket object to create TCP pakcet. 
3. seeker set ICMP header type =8, code =3, data section to null. 
4. seeker call TCPPacket object to create IP pakcet. 
5. seeker set IP header destine ip = target ip, source ip to random ip, insert ICMP into IP data section. 

Job seeker enter large loop to commence attack
------------------------------------------------
1. enter loop 100000000
2. call TCPPacket mehtod to send out IP packet. 
3. terminate once loop is done.  

Job seeker report success and terminate connection 
--------------------------------------------------
1. seeker send success report notify creator.
2. seeker follow communication rule and terminate connection.
