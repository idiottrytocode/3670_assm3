Question 1.2



Description: 

Detect the status of a given port at a given IP address. The status of the port could be open—close—filtered. The port could be TCP or UDP. The job description contains at least the target IP and port number.




Summary: 

1. Job seeker will craft a UDP and a TCP segement based on given IP and port number. 
2. Both segement will be wrapped by IP layer, and will be send to destination. 
3. If the port is not avaliable, then the job seeker will recieve two ICMP mesage "destination unreachable" type 3, code 3. 
4. If the port is filtered, job seeker will recieve no message at all (both packet will be dropped without reply). 
5. If the port is active, then the job seeker will recieve: 
	If the port is TCP only: one TCP hadnshake, and one UDP ICMP mesage "destination unreachable" type 3, code 3.
	If the port is UDP only: one TCP ICMP mesage "destination unreachable" type 3, code 3, and no response for UDP segment. 
	If the port is for both: One TCP handshake and no message for UDP. 


Design: 

Job creator send request
------------------------ 
1 job creator inlcude two string (IP and port number) in its application protocol's data segment. 
2. job creator send this (segment) to transport layer / IP layer through scoket.  
3.  After transport / network layer add thier header and tailer, link layer make it into frame and sent to physical layer, which in turn send on the network.

Job seeker uppacked target info and prepare UDP TCP segement
----------------------------------------------------------------
4. job seeker reveive the bit stream, assemble and unpack all the layer up to application layer. 
5. Once retrived the strings (ip and port), job seeker call pcpp to create two packet, one UDP, one TCP. 

6. Set TCP 
	source port = host ps port 
	destine port = target port 
	all the rest to default 
   Set UDP 
	source port = host ps port 
	destine port = target port 	 
	all the rest to default 
	
7. set data section to null. 	 
8. job seeker call pcpc::?? to create ip object.
9. set IP header: 
	source ip = host id 
	destine ip = target ip
	....
10. encapuslate ICMP inside IP packet's data segement. 
11. send out ip packet 

Job seeker wait response and create final report 
------------------------------------------------
12. If the job seeker recieve two ICMP mesage "destination unreachable" type 3, code 3, then the target port is not avaliable.
13. If job seeker will recieve no message at all (both packet will be dropped without reply), then the port is filtered.
14. If the job seeker recieve TCP hadnshake, and one UDP ICMP mesage "destination unreachable" type 3, code 3, then the port is active and is designed for TCP.
15. If the job seeker recive one TCP ICMP mesage "destination unreachable" type 3, code 3, and no response for UDP segment, then the port is active and desgin for UDP. 
16. if the job seeker recive TCP handshake and no message for UDP, then the port is active and can be used for both TCP and UDP. 
17. job seeker craft report for job creator. 

Job seeker send report and complete job
---------------------------------------
14. job seeker package report into application layer 's data segement, pass it down all the way to datalink layer frame (through socket), and send it back to job creator. 
15. End.
