1. 
Compare and contrast IPV4 and IPV6 highlights the similarities and differences between the two protocols?

similarirty: 
both are used for ip layer internet protocal 
both have header field such as version, header len, source ip, destine ip, etc . 
both are connectionless protocol
both do not have any active congestion control 
both use datagram as frame format

difference:  
ipv4 is older than ipv6
ipv4 total address capacity is much smaller than ipv6
ipv4 have check sum while ipv6 do not 
all other header field in ip4 is different from ip6
ipv4 using numerical address mode 
ipv6 using alpha_numerical
ipv4 was original designed with class and ipv6 have categoty 1-7 
ipv4 and 6 have different secure standards

2. 
What are the main differences between routing and forwarding?

forwarding was originated from the 70s telephone tech, while routing was more advanced. 
forwarding focus on source-destine processing while routing focus on hip to hop transfer. 
The sum of all routing combine is equal in effect to forwarding. 


--------------------------------------------
3. 
What are software-defined networks, and how they are different from traditional routing 

The idea of programmability is the basis for the most precise definition of what SDN is: technology that separates the control plane management of network devices from the underlying data plane that forwards network traffic.


SDN can interact with user via programing while traditonal routing can not. 
SDN use software type to define itself whiel traditional use hardware type to define its architech. 
SDN can use vitual connection while hardware based can not. 

--------------------------------------------
4. What are the most common methods to implement the switch fabric in the routers?

The most traditional way was via memory. This was then repalced by the data bus. Now most router use interconnected network to accomplish the task. 

--------------------------------------------
5. When a large datagram is fragmented into multiple smaller datagrams, are these smaller datagrams reassembled into a single larger datagram? [4 points]

At the destine host, they will be reassembled. 
But during the hops, they are not reassembled. They travel independently. 

--------------------------------------------
6.
What is a private network address? Should a datagram with a private network address ever be
present in the larger public Internet? Explain.

In the early designe of ip4, 3 set of ip address was desiganated as private address. 
Thoes address can be used without permission from internet authority and thus can be repeated used by different user. 
That means if any message with a private address is detected by router in the internet, the message will be dropped. 
Ip6 also inherit this design priciple. 


A private address host, if want to communicate with outside, must send its message to a router designated to handle subnet, swap the address in its NAT, then being sent to outside world. 

--------------------------------------------
7.
Suppose there are 35 hosts in a subnet. What should the IP address structure look like?

becasue there are 35 host,  we need at least 64 bit to mask them, thus 2^(32-n) = 64, n=26

xxxx.xxxx.xxyy.yyyy/26


--------------------------------------------
8.
Compare and contrast the properties of a centralized and a distributed routing algorithm. Give
an example of a routing protocol that takes a centralized and decentralized approach. [4 points]

centralized algo:
	recieve periodic status update from all internet component on its neighbors.
	update overall topologies. 
	all transmition is via the cerntral node. 
	can easily be congested if the volume surge unexpectely. 
	or can be wasted if volume keep low. 

distributed algo:
	allow node to work locally, and reserve a smaller capacity 
	each node have a piece of global table which can refer to the correct sub-group. 
	the topology are much complex but reduce single point failure. 
	
--------------------------------------------
9.
Compare and contrast static and dynamic routing algorithms.

static routring are much more easier to do because:
	it table is static and no complex update algo is needed. 
	it can handle a small set of destine. 
	admin can define it once use it forever. 
dynamic routing is more powerful becuase: 
	constant update to reflect the current status on the network.
	use complex and power algo for optimizing its capacity.
	all automated process 
	good for industrial standard network 
	difficult to understand and need trainner to manipulate. 
--------------------------------------------
10. 
Define and contrast the following terms: subnet, prefix, and BGP route.

Subnet:
During the era of classful address, the subnetting was introduced. It allows an organization, who just being grant a large block of adress, to divide into several contigous group and assign each group to samller network(subnet). 

A subnet is a logical subdivision of an block of ip

The boundaries of the subnet are defined by the router. 



Prefix: 
During the era of classless addressing, prefix was introduced. In this era, when a block of address was not subnetted, it can be viewed as a 2 level architechture, with the 32-n bit define organization network (or we call prefix), and n bit define individual host (we call surfix). 

Some book say its part of CIDR notation, which is partially correct. prefix and CIDR use the same concept but are diffentn thing since its inception. 


BGP route: 
A protocol used for automouns system. 
Since internet is network of smaller network, each router in work must know where to forward its packet. 
BGP route is a infomation package which include details about a router's immediate linked hop(defiend by prefix), and this BGP route will be periodically snet by each router across the network to update it's neirbor's table. 
In other work, BGP use prefix to identify a gruop of ip.

Names four different types of ICMP messages

ICMP can be divided into 2 sub category, error message and query message. 
In error reporting message, there are commonly  5 types: 
destine unreachange: type 3
source quench: type 4
time exceeded: tpye 11 
paramater problem: type 12 
redirection: type 5

In query message there are commonly 4 types: 
echo request/reply: type 8 code 0
timestamp: type 13 code 0 
address mask: type 17 code 18
router solicitation/advertisment: type 10 code 9
